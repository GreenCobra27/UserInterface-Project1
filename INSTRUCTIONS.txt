Welcome to my smart shopping cart!

To begin, load Main.html and PhoneCompanion.html in the web browser of your choice.

Main includes the primary functions of the application.

PhoneCompanion is required for paying at checkout and allows an alternate way to import list.

A sample list is included in this directory under the name "MockList". Use this for testing Import List features. 
You may also make your own list under this directory using the same conventions as MockList. 
If so, here are the items currently included in the store:

Shirt
Pants
Dog Food
Water
Energy Drink
Tomato Sauce
Macaroni

Enjoy using my app!
